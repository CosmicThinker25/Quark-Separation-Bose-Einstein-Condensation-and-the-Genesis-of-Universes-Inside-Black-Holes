## Authors

## Overview
This repository hosts the evolving versions of the speculative research paper that explores the possibility that black hole interiors may act as generative sites for new universes.  
The hypothesis integrates ideas from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Bose–Einstein Condensation (BEC), holography, and Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC).  

- **v1 (Original):** Conceptual and speculative draft in Spanish.  
- **v2 (Revised):** Expanded and refined version in English, with effective equations, toy model proposal, and falsifiable predictions.  

## Files
- `Quark_Separation_v1.pdf` → Original draft.  
- `Quark_Separation_v2.pdf` → Revised and expanded version.  
- Future versions will be added as the research evolves.  

## Future Work
- Implement toy model simulations (GRHD + QCD EoS + Gross–Pitaevskii + LQC).  
- Compare predictions with potential astrophysical observables.  
- Release open-source notebooks and code modules.
